A Phonegap/Cordova app for openwebby.

openwebby.com is a website, a mobile app, a business home, a business practice, an interactive elearning module inspired by Humboldt University of Berlin Blogna Lab's Diversity of Knowledge model, a social channel, a blog, and probably other things to other people. At it's core openwebby is an open source web and native mobile app framework for researching, building, teaching and learning sustainble web systems. The idea of openwebby started out in a completely different format. Openwebby began as a traditional, paperback book and ebook titled Sustainable Web Ecosystem Design which was published by Springer the international publisher of science, technology, and medicine in 2013. (Edition one is currently available from the publisher.) I learned quickly that this was not the optimal format for teaching and learning about proper Web building nor it's inherent often vicissitudes. I have been teaching online and in-residence at universities and colleges, blogging, building web sites and native mobile applications, using social media channels, and developing approachable, asynchronous instructional materials for 20 years, so an interactive version of the idea of openwebby was a natural fit for a composite of these various communication models.
